## Introduction To Python Programming

Hello Stranger 😀

You finally caught that programming itch and after a bit searching here and there you found out that python is the easiest language for beginners. Well the pundits couldn't have been more right.

Let's start with a simple line of code commonly referred to as "Hello, world"

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

That's it and huge congratulations! you've written your first programming language 👏💯
